This project is a little experiment in taking control of your data and weaving it in more personal shapes for sharing on the internet. This

I wanted to dedicate a digital space to the wonder that you find
in your daily experience. This project also experiments with
intimacy through personal but ephemeral glimpses into someone's
life. With the rise of parasocial relationships from social media,

    it a natural extension on top of my normal behavior, an "in situ"

    I'm very captured by the ability of computation to be a natural
    extension of natural behavior, given you extra capabilities "for
    free." The intention of this project was to build a tiny system that
    will evolve on its own, while having the data in an easily
    exportable and extensible interface in case I need to make any
    manual changes.
