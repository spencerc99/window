This project is a little experiment in taking control of your data and weaving it in more personal shapes for sharing on the internet.

I wanted to dedicate a digital space to the wonder that you find
in your daily experience. This project also experiments with
intimacy through personal but ephemeral glimpses into someone's
life. With the rise of parasocial relationships from social media,
I wanted to play with how digital mediums could be used to create
something that felt more personal and human.
